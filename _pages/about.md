Hi. My name is MohammadHossein Abbaspour; an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at [IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en).

### **Summary**

Following my second year of undergraduate studies, I embarked on a journey to learn the fundamental principles of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I pursued knowledge through searching on the internet and online courses, supplementing my learning with university classes such as Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning. Now, as I approach graduation, I am enthusiastic about furthering my education with a focus on AI, particularly in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, and their combination, particularly their trustworthiness.

I thrive in collaborative environments and take great satisfaction in achieving common goals as a team. My passion for continuous learning drives me to persist until I reach my objectives. These qualities propel me forward, and I am excited about the future that lies ahead.

**Outside of my academic** pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for poetry and folk music, and I am going to learn to play a [musical instrument](https://centerforworldmusic.org/2015/06/world-music-instruments-the-setar/).

### **Research**

Currently, my **research** is dedicated to advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by utilizing **multi-agent** discussions and prompt engineering techniques. Through comparative analysis of agent behaviors across different scenarios and iterative multi-round debates, I develop methods to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of their language responses.
