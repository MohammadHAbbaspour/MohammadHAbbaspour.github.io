Hi. My name is MohammadHossein Abbaspour; an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at [IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en).

### **Summary**

Following my second year of undergraduate studies, I embarked on a journey to learn the fundamental principles of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I pursued knowledge through searching on the internet and online courses, supplementing my learning with university classes such as Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning. Now, as I approach graduation, I am enthusiastic about furthering my education with a focus on AI, particularly in the areas of trustworthiness and explainability of AI models.

I thrive in collaborative environments and take great satisfaction in achieving common goals as a team. My passion for continuous learning drives me to persist until I reach my objectives. These qualities propel me forward, and I am excited about the future that lies ahead.

**Outside of my academic** pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for poetry and folk music. Additionally, in my free time I'd rather to play video games especially shooter games.
