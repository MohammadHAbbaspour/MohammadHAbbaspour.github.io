Hi. My name is MohammadHossein Abbaspour; an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at [IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en).

### **Introduction**

I am truly passionate about my field of study, especially the mathematics aspect of it, and now that I am approaching graduation, I am eager to continue my studies in this field and advance my knowledge.

I thrive in collaborative environments and take great satisfaction in achieving common goals as a team. My passion for continuous learning drives me to persist until I reach my objectives. These qualities propel me forward, and I am excited about the future that lies ahead.

**Outside of my academic** pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for poetry and folk music. Additionally, in my free time I'd rather to play video games especially shooter games.
